# Retro-Spacegame

This was my first game ever! It is implemented with libGDX.
LibGDX is a relatively low level, free, open source cross platform game development framework.

I created a 2D video game for Android which brings up memories from 80s when everything started on the video games world.
You can dodge a horde of asteroids with your spaceship with the classic maneuvers animation 
Also the player is able to use bullets against the asteroids to destroy them.
